# tanks-game

The game has two modes, first one is player vs computer and the second one is player vs player (online).
The game has some of musics and sound effects. To play online, the two players must be connected to same WIFI.
The game has two tanks every one of them wants to drop the pther to win the game, in computer mode I made the computer's tank trying to find the player tank and tracking it to drop it and I have used simple idea to solve this problem, I didn't use AI or machine learning.
