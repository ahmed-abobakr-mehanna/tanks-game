# Tanks Game
## Description
This is a multi-threaded game written in Java, The game is about tanks war and it has two modes first one is a player versus the computer and the last one is a player versus player, but this mode is an online mode also in the online mode the players must be connected to the same WIFI.
The game has two tanks each one wants to drop the other two win the game, in the player versus computer there is no possible way to win the game!! The computer is going to win every game and this is due to my decision to make this mode very hard.
## Networking
This game has a networking part to be able to play online and this is a simple and small network, I made this network in UDP because TCP/IP was not working, but to technically speaking the network must be made in TCP/IP.
